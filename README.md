# Cold Calling Agent Workflow – README

This document explains the daily workflow of a **Cold Calling Agent** using the CB East (Facebook‑style) Call Agent Console.

---

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Lead Queue

* The agent logs into the dashboard and views the **Call Queue** in the left sidebar.
* The queue displays companies/contacts with details such as company name, industry, region of interest, and interest score.
* The agent selects a lead to begin.

### 2. Dial

* Using the floating dialer at the bottom‑right corner, the agent dials the prospect’s phone number.
* Call status updates in sequence: **Ringing → Connected**.
* The call session is now active.

### 3. Follow the Script

* In the main workspace, the **Call Script** is available with four key sections:

  1. *Introduction* – Greeting and CB East introduction.
  2. *Reveal Value* – Snapshot of services and benefits.
  3. *Invite Engagement* – Ask for a discovery call or meeting.
  4. *Next Step* – Confirm availability, request email, or schedule follow‑up.
* Each script block includes a **copy button** for quick use.

### 4. Handle Objections

* If the prospect raises objections (e.g., “Not looking to expand right now”), the agent opens the **Objection Handling Table**.
* Pre‑written responses are available, ensuring consistent and effective replies.
* Responses can be copied or inserted into notes.

### 5. Take Notes (Feed Style)

* During or after the call, the agent writes notes in the **Notes Composer**.
* Example note: *“Client is interested in incentives, follow‑up scheduled for next week.”*
* Submitted notes appear in a **feed‑style card** (similar to Facebook posts), with avatar, timestamp, and tags.

### 6. Fill CRM Form

* On the right sidebar, the agent completes the **Call Tracker Form** with fields:

  * Company Name
  * Contact Person
  * Phone, Email
  * Industry, Current Export Markets
  * Interest Level (1–10 slider)
  * Follow‑up Date
* After clicking **Save**, the record is stored locally and appears in a list with options to edit or delete.

### 7. Close the Call

* When the conversation ends, the agent presses **End Call** on the dialer.
* Status changes to **Ended** and the call timer stops.

### 8. Move to Next Lead

* The agent selects the next lead from the Call Queue.
* The cycle repeats, ensuring steady progress.

## Summary

The Cold Calling Agent workflow is designed to be structured, efficient, and repeatable:

**Queue → Dial → Script → Handle Objections → Notes → CRM Record → Next Lead**

This flow reduces friction, ensures consistency, and helps agents maximize effectiveness in outbound calling campaigns.
